# Nexploits

## Description
Nexploits is a Python script that allows users to assign a keyboard button to trigger a function called `sploit()`. This script utilizes Tkinter for the graphical user interface (GUI) and the keyboard module to detect keyboard events.

## Installation
1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system. If not, download and install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).
2. Clone or download the `nexploits.py` file from this repository.

## Setup
1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory where `nexploits.py` is located.
3. Install the required libraries by executing the following command:
```bash
pip install keyboard
```

## Usage
1. Run the script by executing the following command in the terminal or command prompt:
```bash
python nexploits.py
```
2. The Nexploits window will appear with a prompt to select the button to run `sploit()`.
3. Click on the "Select Button" to assign a keyboard button.
4. Press the desired keyboard button to assign it.
5. The selected button will be displayed on the GUI.
6. Close the window to exit the program.

## Notes
- The script will continue running in the background and respond to keyboard events even when the window is minimized or not in focus.
- Replace `sploit()` with your desired function or script to execute when the assigned keyboard button is pressed.
